Transaction (Broadcasted to all nodes) --> Block: (nodes collect transactions to block) --> hash for block found and the hash is boardcasted to all other nodes 


Transaction: 
    - need public and private ellciptic curve keys 
    - **for now** transactions can only involve one coin

Block:
    - Timestamp
    - nonce
    - root hash(hash of all transactions)
    - previous block hash 

Node: 
    - Aggregate transactions into a block 
    - find appropriate hash for block
    - get rewarded for hash with a coin
    - verify other nodes work 

Misc: 
    - increase hash pattern difficulty ?
    ** the network can just be a shared memory region??? **
